This is an updated follower arm to the SO-ARM101 by TheRobotStudio to fit STS 3250 servos from Feetech. I made this as I wanted more torque, and also the 3250s have nicer metal cases with proper mounting points.

There are some other minor changes but it is functionally the same. Various options, and some files for 3D printing are also provided.

This is a remix of the arm originally by TheRobotStudio https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100
