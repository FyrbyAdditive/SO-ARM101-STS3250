This is an updated follower arm to fit STS 3250 servos from Feetech. There are some other minor changes but it is functionally the same. Various options, and some files for 3D printing are also provided.

This is a remix of the arm originally by TheRobotStudio https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100
